# Calculator Website
This is just a website with a calculator in it. I didn't design the calculator.\
The design is from this video: https://youtu.be/j59qQ7YWLxw, \
made by Web Dev Simplified: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw, \
GitHub repository: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Vanilla-JavaScript-Calculator. \
I wrote the JavaScript code only.\
**You may encounter programming floating point problems such as: 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.30000000000000004,\
0.6 + 0.3 === 0.8999999999999999 and 0.1 * 0.2 === 0.020000000000000004.**
